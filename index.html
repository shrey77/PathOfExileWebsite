			<h1>Path of Exile</h1>
			<h2>Introduction and Purpose</h2>
			<p>Path of Exile is an online Action Role-Playing Game (ARPG) that is free-to-play. The developers of Path of Exile is a company called Grinding Gear Games.
			The game can be played alone or in a party of up to 6 players.
			</p>
			<p>The purpose of this website is to try to be a resource that can help teach you some basic information about Path of Exile and also introduce you to some 
			more resources that will be able to help you further. This website is targeted for new players of Path of Exile who want to learn a bit more about the game.
			</p>
			<h2>Path of Exile: Leagues</h2>
			<p>In Path of Exile, there are different leagues that you are able to create a character on. There are two permenant leagues, Standard and Standard Hardcore,
			and two temporary leagues that last 3 months. The next temporary leagues will be the Abyss League, which will have Standard Abyss League and Hardcore Abyss League.
			The difference between Standard and Hardcore leagues is that in Hardcore, dieing on your character means that it will be removed from that league and will be transfered
			to the Standard league. This means you only have one life for your character. For Standard leagues, dieing only affects your character by making you lose experience points.
			<br/><br/>
			Many players exclusively play on the temporary leagues due to the fact that the economy and characters are fresh and there are rewards for completing achievments and objectives
			in game. Also, each temporary league introduces a new and unique mechanic to the game that is exclusive for that league. Some of the past temporary leagues include:

			<h2><a name="passivetree">Path of Exile: Passive Skill Tree</a></h2>
			<p>Path of Exile has a massive passive skill tree that can intimidate any new player. Each time you level up your character, you obtain one passive skill pointer
			that you can spend in the passive skill tree. The passive skill tree is the same for each of the seven classes, but your class determines where you start on the 
			passive skill tree. There are hundreds of nodes that give attributes or special stats that you can choose to invest your skill point you recieve from leveling.
			</p>
			<p>This is the current passive tree:</p>

			<h2>Path of Exile: Classes and Ascendency</h2>
			<p>There are seven classes in Path of Exile. Each class is aligned with one or more of the three main attributes, Strength, Dexterity, and Intelligence. The seven
			classes are <a href="duelist.html">Duelist</a>, <a href="marauder.html">Marauder</a>, <a href="ranger.html">Ranger</a>, <a href="scion.html">Scion</a>,
			 <a href="shadow.html">Shadow</a>, <a href="templar.html">Templar</a>, and <a href="witch.html">Witch</a>.
			</p>
			<p>Ascendency lets your character ascend and choose a sub-class from three different choices, each unique to their primary class from above.</p>
