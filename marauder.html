			<h2>Marauder Information</h2>
			<p>The Marauder is Path of Exile's pure strength class, which means that he's great at taking hits, and even better at dishing out punishment. His melee skills encompass a wide range of assault, from massive single target damage to devastating area of effect. This brute of a man bolsters his impressive physical arsenal with a variety of shouts and cries, skills that rally his allies and strike terror into the hearts of his enemies.
			The equipment associated with the Marauder's strength are Casques, Plate Mail, Gauntlets, Greaves, and Tower Shields.</p>
