			<h2>Scion Information</h2>
			<p>The daughter of corrupt nobles, the Scion was exiled to Wraeclast for killing her husband on their wedding night. She is aligned with all three core attributes - strength, dexterity and intelligence, which places her in the center of the passive skill tree. This unique position allows her to develop into almost any type of character build, while lacking the dedicated specialisation that the other six classes offer.
			Because of her high learning curve, she's initially unavailable to new players. The player must rescue the Scion, who can be found in the final area of Act 3, just before the fight with the final boss of this act. Killing the boss is not required to free the Scion. This can be done on Normal Difficulty (in any league) to unlock her as an accessible character.

			<h2>Scion Ascendency</h2>
			<p>The Scion is unique and only has one choices for Ascendency, the Ascendant.</p>
			<h3>Ascendant</h3>
			<p>The Ascendant offers flexibility more than any other class by allowing the player to take passives based on other Ascendancy classes. These passives offer similar benefits representing the class's overall tree, but with mitigated effects. Only one Ascendancy class passive can be taken from each base class.
