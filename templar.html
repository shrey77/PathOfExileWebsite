			<h2>Templar Information</h2>
			<p>The Templar is Path of Exile's strength/intelligence hybrid class, a perfect balance of brawn and wits. He is a skillful fighter, trained in an array of weapons, from the sharpest cutlass to the heaviest two-handed mace. He's also comfortable wielding a shield, either for additional protection or as a deadly bludgeon. In combat, this pious warrior is expert at augmenting his substantial offense with a wide range of magical abilities. The Templar is also adept at taking punishment, and he's happy to be up at the front lines, serving as a martyr and champion for his ranged companions.
			The armors associated with the Templar's strength and intelligence are Chainmail Coifs/Helmets, Chainmail/Ringmail, Mesh/Chain Gloves, Mesh/Chain Boots, and Kite Shields.</p>

			<h2>Templar Ascendency</h2>
			<p>The Templar has one of three choices for Ascendency: Guardian, Hierophant, Inquisitor.</p>
			<h3>Guardian</h3>
			<p>Guardians are a powerful option for support Templars dedicated to partying, possessing passives that greatly benefit multiple party members. Even as a solo character, Guardians themselves can benefit from its selection of defensive passives.

			<h3>Hierophant</h3>
			<p>The Hierophant deals and takes damage in unconventional methods rather than in a straightforward way. Hierophants can utilize totems effectively, and have the ability to summon 2 additional totems, at the cost of less damage per totem. They also work well with builds that utilize high amounts of Mana by converting it into defensive bonuses. Templars who rely on multiple skills can take Illuminated Devotion to enhance multiple skills with one of three powerful effects.

			<h3>Inquisitor</h3>
			<p>Inquisitors focus on elemental damage. They can, among other things, specialize in critical strikes, elemental penetration or buffing themselves with consecrated ground. Most of their skills are compatible with both attacks and spells.
